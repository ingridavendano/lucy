============

Lucy is a static site generator written in Python.

### Why call her Lucy?
You've heard of Jekyll (Ruby) and Hyde (Python). In the Robert Louis Stevenson (Broadway) adaptation of Jekyll and Hyde, Lucy is the shared love interest of both Jekyll and Hyde.

### Why did you make Lucy? Why are you building things like templating engines and local webservers from scratch?
This project is a learning excercise for my Hackbright Mentee and me. The code will be heavily commented.

### What is Lucy made of?
TBD

### Usage

### In the works:
ALL THE THINGS
